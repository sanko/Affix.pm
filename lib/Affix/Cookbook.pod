=head1 NAME

Affix::Cookbook - Recipes for bridging Perl and C without the pain of XS

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Welcome to the Affix Cookbook.

For decades, the barrier between Perl and the raw speed of C (or Rust, or C++, or Fortran) has been guarded by the
complex, arcane rituals of XS. You had to learn a new macro language, configure a build system, handle the Perl stack
manually, and compile everything before you could even run a "Hello World".

Affix changes the menu.

Affix is a Foreign Function Interface (FFI) built on the low-overhead L<infix|https://github.com/sanko/infix/> JIT
engine. It allows you to bind libraries, marshal complex data structures, and manage memory dynamically, all from
within your Perl script.

=head2 What is in this Cookbook?

This document is a collection of recipes designed to take you from a hungry beginner to a master chef of systems
programming.

We will cover:

=over

=item * B<The Basics:> Calling standard C library functions like C<printf> and C<pow>.

=item * B<The Compiler:> Using L<Affix::Compiler> to write C code directly inside your Perl scripts for instant optimization.

=item * B<Memory Management:> Understanding Pointers, Pins, and how to allocate memory without leaking it.

=item * B<Advanced Structures:> Handling C Structs, Unions, and Arrays as easily as Perl Hashes and Lists.

=item * B<The Exotic:> Callbacks, Function Pointers, and SIMD Vector mathematics.

=back

=head2 Prerequisites

To follow these recipes, you will need:

=over

=item * B<Perl v5.40> or higher (Affix leverages modern Perl features like C<class>).

=item * B<Affix> installed from CPAN.

=item * A C compiler (GCC, Clang, or MSVC) is highly recommended for the advanced recipes, though not strictly required for binding to existing system libraries.

=back

Grab your apron. Let's get cooking.

=head1 Chapter 1: The Instant C Library

Sometimes, you don't have a pre-existing F<.dll> or F<.so> file. Sometimes, you just have an idea, a heavy mathematical
loop, or a snippet of C code you found on Stack Overflow, and you want to run it I<right now> inside your Perl script.

This is where C<Affix::Compiler> shines. It turns your Perl script into a build system, a linker, and a loader, all in
about five lines of code.

Let's look at the classic "Hello World" of pointer manipulation: the Integer Swap.

=head2 The Recipe

    use v5.40;
    use Affix;
    use Affix::Compiler;

    # 1. Spin up the compiler
    my $c = Affix::Compiler->new();

    # 2. Add some C code directly into the script
    $c->add( \<<~'', lang => 'c' );
        void swap(int *a, int *b) {
            int tmp = *b;
            *b = *a;
            *a = tmp;
        }

    # 3. Compile, Link, and Bind
    affix $c->link, swap => [ Pointer [Int], Pointer [Int] ] => Void;

    # 4. Profit
    my $a = 1;
    my $b = 2;

    say "Before: [a,b] = [$a, $b]";

    # Pass references so C can write back to Perl
    swap( \$a, \$b );

    say "After:  [a,b] = [$a, $b]";

=head2 How It Works

This creates a seamless bridge between the two languages. Here is what is happening under the hood:

=over

=item B<1. The Builder>

C<Affix::Compiler-E<gt>new()> creates a temporary workspace. It detects your operating system (Windows, Linux, macOS,
BSD) and hunts for a viable compiler chain (GCC, Clang, MSVC). You don't need to configure Makefiles or worry about
linker flags; the class handles the heavy lifting.

=item B<2. The Source>

We pass the source code as a B<reference to a string> (C<\<<~''>). This tells the compiler, "I'm not giving you a
filename; I'm giving you the raw code." We specify C<lang =E<gt> 'c'>, but C<Affix::Compiler> is a polyglot—it could
just as easily have been C<cpp>, C<rust>, or C<fortran>.

=item B<3. The Link>

Calling C<$c-E<gt>link> triggers the build process. It writes your source to a temp file, compiles it into an object
file, and links it into a dynamic library. It returns the absolute path to that library (e.g., F</tmp/affix_lib.so>).

We pass that path immediately to C<affix>, binding the symbol C<swap>.

=item B<4. The Types>

This is the most critical part of this recipe:

    [ Pointer [Int], Pointer [Int] ]

If we had defined this as C<[ Int, Int ]>, Affix would have passed the I<values> C<1> and C<2> to C. The C code would
have swapped those values in its own local stack and returned, leaving our Perl variables untouched.

By specifying C<Pointer>, we tell Affix we expect a memory address.

=item B<5. The Execution>

Because we defined the types as Pointers, we must pass B<references> to our Perl scalars:

    swap( \$a, \$b );

Affix takes the memory address of the SV (Scalar Value) holding C<$a>, passes it to C, and allows the C code to
overwrite the memory directly. When C<swap> returns, C<$a> sees the data that was previously in C<$b>.

=back

=head2 Kitchen Reminders

=over

=item * B<Compiler Required>

While C<Affix> works on any machine, C<Affix::Compiler> obviously requires a C compiler (like C<gcc>, C<clang>, or
Visual Studio) to be in your system's C<PATH>.

=item * B<Automatic Cleanup>

By default, C<Affix::Compiler> creates a temporary directory for the build artifacts. When your script ends, that
directory is wiped clean. If you want to inspect the generated C files or the F<.so> library for debugging, pass
C<clean =E<gt> 0> to the constructor:

    my $c = Affix::Compiler->new( clean => 0, debug => 1 );

=item * B<Type Safety>

C is unforgiving. If you tell Affix the argument is a C<Pointer[Int]>, but you pass a string like C<"Hello">, Affix
will try to make it work, but the C code effectively interprets the bytes of that string as an integer. Always match
your Perl data types to your Affix definitions.

=back

=head1 Chapter 2: Speaking Windows (Unicode)

When interacting with the Windows API (Win32), you will inevitably face two facts: libraries are named things like
F<user32.dll>, and text is almost always expected to be UTF-16 (Wide Characters).

Perl works natively in UTF-8. In the old days of XS, bridging this gap involved tedious calls to C<MultiByteToWideChar>
and manual buffer management.

Affix handles the translation for you.

=head2 The Recipe

This recipe displays a native Windows message box containing Unicode characters (an emoji).

    use v5.40;
    use utf8; # Required for literal emojis in source
    use Affix;

    # Define some standard Windows constants
    use constant MB_OK                   => 0x00000000;
    use constant MB_DEFAULT_DESKTOP_ONLY => 0x00020000;

    # Bind the function
    # Library: user32.dll
    # Symbol:  MessageBoxW (The Unicode version)
    # Alias:   MessageBox  (What we call it in Perl)
    affix 'user32', [ MessageBoxW => 'MessageBox' ] =>
        [ Pointer [Void], WString, WString, UInt ] => Int;

    # Call it
    # undef becomes NULL (No owner window)
    MessageBox( undef, 'Keep your stick on the ice.', '🏒', MB_OK | MB_DEFAULT_DESKTOP_ONLY );

=head2 How It Works

=over

=item B<1. The A vs. W Suffix>

Most Windows functions come in two flavors: B<ANSI> (ending in C<A>) and B<Wide> (ending in C<W>). C<MessageBoxA>
expects system-codepage strings (like ASCII), while C<MessageBoxW> expects UTF-16.

Since modern Perl is Unicode-aware, we almost always want the B<W> version.

=item B<2. Aliasing>

We bind the symbol C<MessageBoxW>, but that is a clumsy name to type in Perl. By passing an array reference C<[
'MessageBoxW' =E<gt> 'MessageBox' ]>, we tell Affix to look up the real symbol in the DLL but install it into our
namespace as C<MessageBox>.

=item B<3. The WString Type>

This is the magic ingredient.

    [ ..., WString, WString, ... ]

When you pass a Perl string to a C<WString> argument, Affix performs the following steps on the fly:

=over

=item 1. Check the internal encoding of the Perl scalar.

=item 2. Transcode the string into UTF-16LE (Little Endian).

=item 3. Append a double-null terminator (C<\0\0>).

=item 4. Pass the pointer to the C function.

=back

This allows us to pass the hockey stick emoji C<'🏒'> directly.

=item B<4. The Null Pointer>

The first argument to C<MessageBox> is a handle to an owner window (C<HWND>). Since we don't have a parent window, we
pass C<NULL>.

In Affix, C<NULL> is represented by Perl's C<undef>. When passed to a C<Pointer> type, C<undef> is automatically
converted to address C<0x0>.

=back

=head2 Kitchen Reminders

=over

=item * B<Input Only>

The C<WString> type is designed for B<input> strings (C<LPCWSTR> or C<const wchar_t*>). Affix creates a temporary
buffer for the duration of the call. If the C function intends to I<modify> the string buffer, you must use
C<Pointer[WChar]> and manage the memory yourself using C<calloc>.

=item * B<Use utf8>

If you are typing special characters like '🏒' directly into your Perl script, always remember C<use utf8;> at the
top of your file, or Perl might interpret the bytes incorrectly before Affix even sees them.

=back

=head1 Chapter 3: Binary Data (The Null Byte Trap)

C strings are simple: they start at a memory address and end at the first zero byte (C<\0>).

But what if your data I<contains> zeros? If you use standard string types like C<String> or C<Array[Char]>, C (and
Affix) will assume the data ends at the first null byte. This is fatal for encryption, compression, and binary formats.

To handle this, we must stop thinking in B<Characters> and start thinking in B<Bytes>.

=head2 The Recipe

We will modify the XOR Cipher example. Since the data might contain nulls, we handle it as a raw buffer.

    use v5.40;
    use Affix qw[:all];
    use Affix::Compiler;

    # 1. Compile the C library
    my $c = Affix::Compiler->new();
    $c->add( \<<~'END', lang => 'c' );
        #include <stdlib.h>
        #include <string.h>

        char * string_crypt(const char * input, int len, const char * key) {
            char * output = malloc(len + 1);
            if (!output) return NULL;
            output[len] = '\0';

            int key_len = strlen(key);
            for (int i = 0; i < len; i++) {
                output[i] = input[i] ^ key[i % key_len];
            }
            return output;
        }

        void string_free(void * p) { free(p); }
    END

    my $lib = $c->link;

    # 2. Bind the functions
    # Return Pointer[Void] to get the raw address (Pin) without interpretation.
    affix $lib, 'string_crypt', [ String, Int, String ] => Pointer[Void];
    affix $lib, 'string_free',  [ Pointer[Void] ]       => Void;

    # 3. The Wrapper
    sub cipher( $input, $key ) {
        my $len = length($input);

        # Call C. We get back a Pin (unmanaged pointer).
        my $ptr = string_crypt( $input, $len, $key );
        return undef if is_null($ptr);

        # Create a view of the memory as an Array of Bytes (UInt8).
        # Important:
        #   Array[Char]  => Reads up to NULL (String behavior)
        #   Array[UInt8] => Reads exactly $len bytes (Binary behavior)
        my $view = cast( $ptr, Array[UInt8, $len] );

        # Dereference the view ($$view).
        # For byte arrays, Affix returns a binary string directly.
        my $binary_string = $$view;

        # Clean up the C memory immediately
        string_free($ptr);

        return $binary_string;
    }

    # 4. Run it
    my $orig = 'hello world!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!';
    my $key  = 'foobar';

    my $enc = cipher( $orig, $key );
    my $dec = cipher( $enc,  $key );

    say "Original:  $orig";
    say "Decrypted: $dec";

    # Verify the binary data size
    say "Encrypted length: " . length($enc);

    use JSON::PP;
    say "Encrypted blob:   " . encode_json([$enc]);

=head2 How It Works

=over

=item B<1. Pointer[Void]>

We define the return type as C<Pointer[Void]> to prevent Affix from automatically attempting to read it as a
null-terminated string. We receive a raw B<Pin>.

=item B<2. Casting to Array[UInt8]>

    my $view = cast( $ptr, Array[UInt8, $len] );

We use C<UInt8> (unsigned 8-bit integer) instead of C<Char>. This tells Affix we are dealing with raw binary data, not
text. Affix will read exactly C<$len> bytes from memory, regardless of nulls.

=item B<3. Dereferencing>

    my $binary_string = $$view;

When you dereference a Pin defined as an C<Array> of 8-bit types, Affix optimizes the operation. It copies the raw
bytes directly into a Perl scalar.

=back

=head2 Kitchen Reminders

=over

=item * B<Char vs UInt8>

In Affix, C<Array[Char]> is treated as a string buffer (stops at null). C<Array[UInt8]> is treated as a byte buffer
(reads full length). Use the one matching your data.

=back

=head1 Chapter 4: Strings and Static State

Dealing with C strings usually involves asking "Who owns this memory?"

In Perl, strings are values. In C, they are pointers. A common (though not thread-safe) pattern in C libraries is to
return a pointer to an internal static buffer. This buffer is overwritten or freed the next time the function is
called.

If you were using raw pointers, this would be dangerous; your Perl variable would suddenly change its value or point to
freed memory when you made a subsequent API call.

Affix solves this by copying string return values into Perl's memory space immediately.

=head2 The Recipe

In this example, we implement a C function that remembers its last result. It frees the old result before allocating a
new one. We use a final call with C<undef> to trigger a cleanup.

    use v5.40;
    use Affix qw[:all];
    use Affix::Compiler;

    # 1. Compile the C library
    my $c = Affix::Compiler->new();
    $c->add( \<<~'END', lang => 'c' );
        #include <stdlib.h>
        #include <string.h>

        const char * string_reverse(const char * input) {
            // Static pointer persists across function calls
            static char * output = NULL;
            int i, len;

            // Cleanup previous call's memory
            if (output != NULL) {
                free(output);
                output = NULL;
            }

            // Handle "Cleanup Mode" (NULL input)
            if (input == NULL)
                return NULL;

            // Allocate new buffer
            len = strlen(input);
            output = malloc(len + 1);

            // Reverse the string
            for (i = 0; input[i]; i++)
                output[len - i - 1] = input[i];
            output[len] = '\0';

            return output;
        }
    END

    my $lib = $c->link;

    # 2. Bind the function
    # String means "const char*" for input and output.
    affix $lib, 'string_reverse', [String] => String;

    # 3. Use it
    # Input:  "\nHello world"
    # Output: "dlrow olleH\n"
    print string_reverse("\nHello world");

    # 4. Cleanup
    # Passing undef sends NULL to C, triggering the free() logic.
    string_reverse(undef);

=head2 How It Works

=over

=item B<1. Passing Strings (Input)>

    [ String ] => ...

When passing a Perl string to a C<String> argument, Affix temporarily allocates a C buffer, copies the Perl string
(encoded as UTF-8), and passes that pointer to C. This buffer is valid only for the duration of the call.

=item B<2. Returning Strings (Output)>

    ... => String

When a C function returns a C<String> type, Affix reads the memory at that address (up to the first null byte), creates
a B<new> Perl scalar containing those bytes, and returns the scalar.

It does B<not> return a pointer to the C memory.

This is crucial for this recipe. Even though the C function eventually calls C<free(output)> on the next invocation,
our Perl variable holding C<"dlrow olleH\n"> remains safe because it is a distinct copy.

=item B<3. Passing Undef>

    string_reverse(undef);

For string arguments, C<undef> is marshalled as C<NULL> (0x0). Our C function checks for this to perform its cleanup
duties.

=back

=head2 Kitchen Reminders

=over

=item * B<Copy vs. Reference>

If you want a copy of the text (standard Perl behavior), use the type C<String>. If you want to modify the C memory
buffer in place or hold onto the specific memory address, use C<Pointer[Char]> (see Chapter 3).

=item * B<Thread Safety>

While Affix is thread-safe, C functions using C<static> variables (like the one in this recipe) are generally B<not>
thread-safe. If two threads call C<string_reverse> at the same time, they will race to free/overwrite the same static
pointer.

=back

=head1 Chapter 5: The Standard Library (Hello World)

Every operating system comes with a "Standard C Library" (libc). It contains the fundamental building blocks of C
programming: memory allocation, file I/O, string manipulation, and system calls.

Affix provides a shortcut to access this library without you needing to know its exact filename (which varies wildly
between Linux, macOS, and Windows).

=head2 The Recipe

We will bind the standard C function C<puts> (put string). It takes a string, prints it to Standard Output (stdout),
and appends a newline character.

    use v5.40;
    use Affix;

    # 1. Bind
    # libc is a helper function exported by Affix.
    # It returns the handle to the system's standard library.
    affix libc, 'puts' => [String] => Int;

    # 2. Call
    # Note: puts() automatically adds a newline "\n"
    puts('Hello World');

    # 3. Check Result
    # puts returns a non-negative integer on success, or EOF (-1) on error.
    my $ret = puts('Affix makes FFI easy.');
    if ($ret >= 0) {
        say "Successfully wrote to stdout.";
    }

=head2 How It Works

=over

=item B<1. The C<libc> Helper>

Finding the standard library is platform-dependent:

=over

=item * Linux: F<libc.so.6> (usually)

=item * macOS: F<libSystem.B.dylib>

=item * Windows: F<msvcrt.dll> (or F<ucrtbase.dll>)

=back

The C<libc> function (exported by Affix) handles this detection logic for you, returning the correct handle for your
operating system.

=item B<2. The C<puts> Function>

The C signature for `puts` is:

    int puts(const char *s);

We map this to:

    [String] => Int

When you call C<puts('Hello')>, Affix takes your Perl string, ensures it is null-terminated, and passes the pointer to
C. The C library writes the bytes to the file descriptor for STDOUT.

=back

=head2 Kitchen Reminders

=over

=item * B<Output Buffering>

Perl and C use their own IO buffers. If you mix C<print "...">, C<say "...">, and C<puts(...)> in the same script, the
output might appear out of order depending on when the buffers are flushed. Setting C<$| = 1;> in Perl usually helps,
but doesn't strictly control the C buffer.

=item * B<Implicit Newlines>

Unlike Perl's C<print>, C<puts> always adds a newline. If you want to print without a newline using C, you would need
to bind C<printf> (which is a variadic function—see the Variadic recipes).

=back

=head1 Chapter 6: Opaque Pointers (C++)

Perl cannot directly instantiate a C++ class or read a C struct unless we define every single field in Affix. Often, we
don't care about the fields. We just want to hold onto the object and pass it back to the library later.

This pattern is called the **Opaque Pointer** (or Opaque Handle). We treat the object as a black box (C<Pointer[Void]>)
and use helper functions to interact with it.

=head2 The Recipe

We will create a simple C++ `Person` struct, wrap it with C-compatible helpers, and bind it to Perl.

    use v5.40;
    use Affix qw[:all];
    use Affix::Compiler;

    # 1. Compile the C++ Library
    my $c = Affix::Compiler->new();
    $c->add( \<<~'END', lang => 'cpp' );
        #include <stdlib.h>
        #include <string.h>

        typedef struct {
            char * name;
            unsigned int age;
        } Person;

        // extern "C" prevents C++ Name Mangling.
        // This ensures the symbols in the DLL are just "person_new",
        // not "_Z10person_newPKcj".
        extern "C" {

            Person * person_new(const char * name, unsigned int age) {
                Person * self = (Person *) malloc(sizeof(Person));
                self->name = strdup(name);
                self->age = age;
                return self;
            }

            const char * person_name(Person * self) {
                return self->name;
            }

            unsigned int person_age(Person * self) {
                return self->age;
            }

            void person_free(Person * self) {
                if (self) {
                    free(self->name);
                    free(self);
                }
            }
        }
    END

    my $lib = $c->link;

    # 2. Define the Opaque Type
    # We tell Affix: "Whenever you see 'Person', treat it as a void pointer."
    typedef Person => Pointer[Void];

    # 3. Bind
    # Notice we use Person() as the type.
    affix $lib, 'person_new',  [ String, UInt ] => Person();
    affix $lib, 'person_name', [ Person() ]     => String;
    affix $lib, 'person_age',  [ Person() ]     => UInt;
    affix $lib, 'person_free', [ Person() ]     => Void;

    # 4. Use
    my $roger = person_new( 'Roger Frooble Bits', 35 );

    # $roger is just a blessed scalar holding a memory address.
    # We pass it back to C to get data.
    say "Name: " . person_name($roger);
    say "Age:  " . person_age($roger);

    # Clean up
    person_free($roger);

=head2 How It Works

=over

=item B<1. extern "C">

C++ compilers "mangle" function names (e.g., C<person_new> becomes C<_Z10person_newPKcj>) to support function
overloading. This is a nightmare to bind. Wrapping your helper functions in C<extern "C"> forces the compiler to use
standard C names.

=item B<2. The Shim Pattern>

We didn't bind the C++ struct fields directly. Instead, we wrote small C helper functions (Shims) to access the data:

    const char * person_name(Person * self) { return self->name; }

This insulates your Perl code from changes in the C++ class layout.

=item B<3. Typedef Aliases>

    typedef Person => Pointer[Void];

This creates a named alias. While C<Pointer[Void]> works, using C<Person()> in your signatures makes the code
self-documenting. It also prevents accidents—if you later define C<Car => Pointer[Void]>, Affix won't stop you from
passing a Car to a Person function (since they are both just pointers), but your code will be much easier to read and
debug.

=back

=head2 Kitchen Reminders

=over

=item * B<Constructors must Return>

It seems obvious, but in C++, forgetting to C<return self;> in a constructor function is easy to do and leads to
immediate Segfaults or Illegal Instruction errors.

=item * B<Memory Ownership>

Since C<person_new> used C<malloc>, the memory belongs to the C heap. You must explicitly call C<person_free> to
release it. Affix cannot garbage collect these opaque pointers automatically unless you attach a destructor using
Perl's C<DESTROY> (which is an advanced topic for another chapter).

=back

=head1 Chapter 7: System Libraries (Desktop Notifications)

Perl scripts often live in the terminal, but they don't have to stay there.

On Linux (and BSDs with a desktop environment), the C<libnotify> library allows applications to send pop-up
notifications to the user. These are the bubbles you see from apps like Slack, Discord, or your system updater.

This library uses the GLib object system (GObject), which is notoriously complex to bind manually. However, if we only
want to trigger a notification, we can treat the objects as B<Opaque Pointers> and ignore the internal complexity
entirely.

=head2 The Recipe

    use v5.40;
    use Affix;

    # 1. Find the library
    # locate_lib searches system paths (like /usr/lib) for libnotify.so

    my $libnotify = Affix::locate_lib('notify');

    unless ($libnotify) {
        die "Could not find libnotify. Are you on Linux with libnotify-bin installed?";
    }

    # Clean up
    notify_uninit();

=head2 How It Works

=over

=item B<1. Locating Libraries>

    my $libnotify = Affix::locate_lib('notify');

Unlike C<load_library> (which loads the DLL into memory immediately), C<locate_lib> scans the system's dynamic linker
paths (like C<LD_LIBRARY_PATH>) and returns the filename. We pass this path to C<affix>, which handles the loading.

=item B<2. Ignoring Complexity>

The C<notify_notification_new> function returns a C<NotifyNotification*>. In C, this is a struct with many private
fields and GObject metadata. In Perl, we don't care. We define the return type as C<Pointer[Void]>.

As long as we pass that pointer back to other functions in the same library (like C<notify_notification_show>),
everything works.

=item B<3. Optional Error Handling>

The C signature for C<show> is:

    gboolean notify_notification_show (NotifyNotification *notification, GError **error);

The second argument is a pointer-to-a-pointer that the library fills if an error occurs. By passing C<undef>, Affix
sends a C<NULL>, telling the library we don't want to receive error details.

=item * B<Platform Specific>

This recipe works on Linux/BSD with a freedesktop.org compliant notification daemon (GNOME, KDE, XFCE, etc.). It will
likely fail to find the library on Windows or vanilla macOS.

=item * B<Unicode>

Notice we used an emoji in the app name: C<'Affix 🏒'>. Because we used the C<String> type, Affix automatically
encoded this as UTF-8, which is what modern Linux libraries expect.

=back

=head1 Chapter 8: Manual Memory Management

Perl handles memory for you. C does not. When you start allocating raw memory buffers in Affix, you are stepping into
the C world.

This recipe demonstrates how to manually allocate, manipulate, and free memory using the standard C lifecycle.

=head2 The Recipe

    use v5.40;
    use Affix qw[:all];

    # 1. Allocation
    # We allocate 14 bytes.
    # malloc returns a Pointer[Void] (a Pin).
    my $void_ptr = malloc( 14 );

    # 2. String Duplication
    # strdup allocates new memory containing a copy of the string.
    my $ptr_string = strdup("hello there!!\n");

    # 3. Memory Copy
    # We copy 15 bytes (text + null terminator) from one pointer to another.
    # memcpy works on raw pointers, so passing $void_ptr is fine.
    memcpy( $void_ptr, $ptr_string, 15 );

    # 4. Read (The Cast)
    # Dereferencing $void_ptr ($$void_ptr) would just return the memory address
    # as an integer, because Affix doesn't know what's inside.
    # We must CAST it to a specific type to read it.
    my $str_view = cast( $void_ptr, String );

    print $str_view;

    # 5. Cleanup
    # These are managed pointers, so Perl *would* free them when the variables
    # go out of scope. But in C, explicit is better than implicit.
    free($ptr_string);
    free($void_ptr);

=head2 How It Works

=over

=item B<1. Malloc returns Void>

    my $void_ptr = malloc( 14 );

Just like in C, C<malloc> returns a C<void*>. It represents a chunk of raw memory with no type information attached.

=item B<2. Cast adds Meaning>

    my $str_view = cast( $void_ptr, String );

Casting creates a B<new Pin> that points to the I<same memory address> but has different type metadata.

    $void_ptr  -> Address 0x1234, Type: *void
    $str_view  -> Address 0x1234, Type: *char

When you dereference C<$$str_view>, Affix sees the type is C<String> and reads the memory until the null terminator.

=item B<3. Pointer Arithmetic via memcpy>

    memcpy( $void_ptr, $ptr_string, 15 );

This is a raw memory operation. It doesn't care about types; it just moves bytes. This is extremely fast, but dangerous
if you get the length wrong. Always ensure your destination buffer is large enough to hold the source data.

=item B<4. Explicit Free>

    free($void_ptr);

Affix uses Perl's memory allocator (C<safemalloc>) for C<malloc>, C<calloc>, and C<strdup>. This means these pointers
are distinct from pointers allocated by a loaded C library (which use the system C<malloc>).

Always use Affix's C<free> for Affix-created pointers, and the library's free function for library-created pointers.

=back

=head2 Kitchen Reminders

=over

=item * B<The Void Default>

If you see a large integer when you expected data (e.g. C<2029945...>), you are dereferencing a C<Pointer[Void]>. Use
C<cast($ptr, Type)> to tell Affix how to read the data.

=item * B<Buffer Overflows>

Perl protects you from buffer overflows. Affix does not. C<memcpy> will happily write past the end of your allocation
and corrupt your program's memory. Measure twice, cut once.

=back

=head1 Chapter 9: Arrays vs. Pointers (The Sentinel)

In C, arrays and pointers are cousins. In function arguments, they are twins. Declaring C<void func(int a[])> is
exactly the same as C<void func(int *a)>.

However, in Affix, B<Types Matter>.

=over

=item * B<C<Pointer[Int]>> expects a I<Reference> to a scalar integer (memory address).

=item * B<C<Array[Int]>> expects a I<List> of integers (data).

=back

This recipe shows how to pass lists of data to C using the C<Array> type, which handles allocation and copying for you.

=head2 The Recipe

We will wrap a C function that sums a zero-terminated array of integers.

    use v5.40;
    use Affix qw[:all];
    use Affix::Compiler;

    # 1. Compile C
    my $c = Affix::Compiler->new();
    $c->add( \<<~'END', lang => 'c' );
        #include <stdlib.h>

        int array_sum(const int * a) {
            int i, sum;
            if (a == NULL)
                return -1; // Error code for NULL

            // Loop until we hit a 0
            for (i = 0, sum = 0; a[i] != 0; i++)
                sum += a[i];
            return sum;
        }
    END

    # 2. Bind
    # We use Array[Int] to tell Affix: "Expect a list of numbers"
    # Affix automatically handles the C "Array Decay" (passing as pointer).
    affix $c->link, array_sum => [ Array[Int] ] => Int;

    # 3. Call

    # Pass undef -> NULL
    say "Undef: " . array_sum(undef);        # -1

    # Pass [0] -> {0} -> Sums to 0 (Immediate stop)
    say "Zero:  " . array_sum( [0] );        # 0

    # Pass List -> {1, 2, 3, 0} -> Sums to 6
    say "List:  " . array_sum( [ 1, 2, 3, 0 ] ); # 6

=head2 How It Works

=over

=item B<1. Array Marshalling>

    array_sum( [ 1, 2, 3, 0 ] );

When you define an argument as C<Array[Int]>, Affix allocates a temporary C array, copies the values from your Perl
array reference into it, and passes the B<pointer> to the C function. This matches C's array decay rules.

=item B<2. The Undef Case>

    array_sum(undef);

C allows array pointers to be NULL. Affix supports this by checking for C<undef> and passing C<NULL> to the function,
skipping the allocation entirely.

=back

=head2 Kitchen Reminders

=over

=item * B<Syntactic Sugar>

You I<could> have bound this function using C<Pointer[Int]>. If you did, you would have to manually pack a binary
string or use C<malloc> to create the buffer. C<Array[Int]> handles that boilerplate for you.

=item * B<Sentinels>

Notice we passed C<0> at the end of our list: C<[1, 2, 3, 0]>. Affix does B<not> automatically append null terminators
to numeric arrays (unlike Strings). Since our C function relies on finding a C<0> to stop the loop, we must provide it
explicitly.

=back

=head1 Chapter 10: Mutable Arrays

In C, arrays passed to functions are often used as output buffers. The function reads data from the array, modifies it
in place, and expects the caller to see the changes.

Affix supports this B<Array Write-Back> automatically.

=head2 The Recipe

We will define a C function that reverses an integer array in place.

    use v5.40;
    use Affix qw[:all];
    use Affix::Compiler;

    # 1. Compile C
    my $c = Affix::Compiler->new();
    $c->add( \<<~'END', lang => 'c' );
        // Reverses array 'a' in place
        int array_reverse(int a[], int len) {
            int tmp, i;
            int ret = 0; // Sum of first half (arbitrary logic)
            for (i = 0; i < len / 2; i++) {
                ret += a[i];
                tmp = a[i];
                a[i] = a[len - i - 1];
                a[len - i - 1] = tmp;
            }
            return ret;
        }

        // Wrapper for fixed-size 10-element array
        int array_reverse10(int a[10]) {
            return array_reverse(a, 10);
        }
    END
    my $lib = $c->link;

    # 2. Bind
    # Dynamic length array
    affix $lib, array_reverse => [ Array[Int], Int ], Int;

    # Fixed length array
    affix $lib, array_reverse10 => [ Array[Int, 10] ], Int;

    # 3. Call (Fixed Size)
    my @a = ( 1 .. 10 );
    array_reverse10( \@a );
    say "@a"; # Output: 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1

    # 4. Call (Dynamic Size)
    my $b = [ 1 .. 20 ];
    array_reverse( $b, 20 );
    say "@$b"; # Output: 20 19 ... 2 1

=head2 How It Works

=over

=item B<1. In-Place Modification>

When you pass a Perl ArrayRef to an C<Array> argument:     1. Affix allocates a temporary C array.     2. Copies your
data into it.     3. Calls the C function.     4. B<Copies the data back> from C to your Perl array.

This ensures that any changes made by the C function are reflected in your Perl variable.

=item B<2. Fixed Size Padding>

    affix ..., [ Array[Int, 10] ] ...

If you define a fixed size (e.g. 10) but pass a shorter list (e.g. C<[1, 2]>), Affix allocates the full 10 integers and
zero-fills the rest. This protects the C function from reading garbage memory if it assumes the array is 10 elements
long.

=back

=head2 Kitchen Reminders

=over

=item * B<Performance>

Copying arrays back and forth (Perl -> C -> Perl) takes time. For very large datasets where you only need to modify a
few bytes, consider using C<malloc> and C<Pointer> types to keep the data in C memory (Chapter 8).

=item * B<Reference Requirement>

You must pass a reference (C<\@a> or C<$array_ref>). Passing a list directly (e.g. C<array_reverse([1,2], ...)>) works,
but the modifications will be lost because the anonymous array reference is discarded immediately after the call.

=back

=head1 Chapter 11: Variadic Functions (printf)

Some C functions don't have a fixed number of arguments. The most famous example is C<printf>, which takes a format
string and... I<everything else>.

Affix supports variadic functions, but they require a little more care than standard functions because the C compiler
isn't there to cast types for you.

=head2 The Recipe

We will wrap the standard C library's C<snprintf>. This is safer than C<printf> because it writes to a buffer.

We also handle a common cross-platform annoyance: on Windows, this function is often named C<_snprintf>, while on
Linux/macOS it is C<snprintf>. We can normalize this using symbol aliasing.

    use v5.40;
    use Affix;

    # 1. Bind snprintf
    # Windows uses _snprintf, POSIX uses snprintf.
    # We detect the OS and bind the correct symbol to the name 'snprintf'.
    my $symbol = $^O eq 'MSWin32' ? '_snprintf' : 'snprintf';

    # Signature: int snprintf(char *str, size_t size, const char *format, ...);
    # We use '...' (or VarArgs) to indicate the variadic part.
    affix libc, [ $symbol => 'snprintf' ],
        [ Pointer[Char], Int, String, VarArgs ] => Int;

    # 2. Prepare a buffer
    # We need a place for C to write the formatted string.
    my $size = 100;
    my $buffer = "\0" x $size;

    # 3. Call with Inference
    # Affix guesses the C type based on the Perl value.
    #   "A String" -> char*
    #   123        -> int64_t
    #   12.34      -> double
    snprintf(
        $buffer, $size,
        "Name: %s, ID: %d, Score: %.2f",
        "Alice", 42, 99.9
    );

    # Clean up the null terminator and print
    $buffer =~ s/\0.*//;
    say $buffer; # "Name: Alice, ID: 42, Score: 99.90"

    # 4. Explicit Coercion
    # Sometimes inference isn't enough.
    # Here we want to print a pointer address (%p).
    # Passing a Perl integer might be interpreted as a value, not a pointer.
    # We use coerce() to force specific types.
    my $ptr = 0xDEADBEEF;

    snprintf(
        $buffer, $size,
        "Pointer address: %p",
        coerce( Pointer[Void], $ptr )
    );

    $buffer =~ s/\0.*//;
    say $buffer;

=head2 How It Works

=over

=item B<1. Symbol Aliasing>

    affix $lib, [ 'RealSymbol', 'PerlName' ], ...

Often, C libraries have messy naming conventions or platform-specific quirks (like C<_snprintf> vs C<snprintf>), or the
library has mangled symbol names. By passing an array reference as the symbol name, you tell Affix: "Find B<RealSymbol>
in the library, but create a Perl subroutine named B<PerlName>."

=item B<2. VarArgs in Signature>

    [ ..., VarArgs ]

The C<VarArgs> constant (or the string C<';'>) tells Affix: "Stop checking types here. Everything after this point is
dynamic."

=item B<3. Dynamic JIT>

When you call a variadic function, Affix looks at the arguments you provided I<at that moment>. It generates a custom,
temporary API signature on the fly (e.g., C<(char*, size_t, char*, char*, int64, double)>) and compiles a trampoline
for it.

These trampolines are cached, so calling C<snprintf> repeatedly with the same argument types is fast.

=item B<4. Coercion>

    coerce( Type, $value )

If you need to pass a C<float> (not double), a C<short>, or a C<struct> by value, the default inference won't work.
C<coerce> attaches a "Type Hint" to the value. Affix sees this hint and uses the exact type you requested.

=back

=head2 Kitchen Reminders

=over

=item * B<Format Strings>

Affix does not validate your format string (e.g. C<"%s">). If you pass an integer to a C<%s> placeholder, C<snprintf>
will try to read memory at address 123 and likely segfault.

=item * B<Sentinels>

Some variadic functions (like C<execl> or certain GUI builders) expect a C<NULL> sentinel at the end of the list. Don't
forget to pass C<undef> (or C<coerce(Pointer[Void], undef)>) if the C API requires it.

=back

=head1 Chapter 12: Callbacks (qsort)

C libraries often use "Callback functions" to delegate logic back to the user. The standard library's C<qsort> is the
classic example: it knows how to sort, but it doesn't know I<how> to compare your data. It asks you to provide a
function for that.

Affix allows you to pass a standard Perl subroutine (CodeRef) where C expects a function pointer.

=head2 The Recipe

We will sort a list of integers using the C standard library's C<qsort>.

    use v5.40;
    use Affix;

    # 1. Bind qsort
    # void qsort(void *base, size_t nmemb, size_t size,
    #            int (*compar)(const void *, const void *));
    #
    # The callback signature is defined inside the argument list.
    # Callback[ [Args...] => ReturnType ]
    affix libc, 'qsort',
        [
            Pointer[Int],
            Size_t,
            Size_t,
            Callback[ [Pointer[Int], Pointer[Int]] => Int ]
        ] => Void;

    # 2. Prepare Data
    # qsort works on a raw memory array.
    # We create a C array of integers.
    my $nums = [ 88, 56, 100, 2, 25 ];
    my $count = scalar @$nums;

    # 3. Define the Comparator
    # C passes us pointers to the two items being compared.
    # We must dereference them to get the values.
    my $compare_fn = sub ( $p_a, $p_b ) {
        my $a = $$p_a;
        my $b = $$p_b;
        return $a <=> $b;
    };

    # 4. Call
    # We pass the ArrayRef directly. Affix handles the pointer decay
    # and write-back (see Chapter 10).
    # sizeof(int) is usually 4.
    qsort( $nums, $count, 4, $compare_fn );

    say join(", ", @$nums); # 2, 25, 56, 88, 100

=head2 How It Works

=over

=item B<1. The Callback Type>

    Callback[ [Pointer[Int], Pointer[Int]] => Int ]

This tells Affix to create a B<Reverse Trampoline>. It generates a small piece of C code that looks like a standard C
function. When that C code is called by C<qsort>, it:

1. Marshals the C arguments (two pointers) into Perl variables. 2. Calls your Perl subroutine C<$compare_fn>. 3. Takes
the integer return value and passes it back to C.

=item B<2. Pointer Dereferencing>

    my $a = $$p_a;

In the callback signature, we claimed the arguments were C<Pointer[Int]>. Affix receives the raw address from C, wraps
it in a B<Pin> with the type C<Int>, and passes it to your sub. Dereferencing it reads the integer value from memory.

=back

=head2 Kitchen Reminders

=over

=item * B<Scope and Lifecycle>

The magic trampoline created for your subroutine exists only as long as the C call is running. If you pass a callback
to a C function that stores it for later use (like setting an event handler in a GUI library), you must ensure your
Perl CodeRef stays alive.

=item * B<Exceptions>

If your Perl callback dies (throws an exception), Affix catches it, issues a warning, and returns a zero/void value to
C to prevent crashing the host application. C does not understand Perl exceptions.

=back

=pod

=head1 Chapter 13: Transparent Structs

Sometimes you need to peek inside the box.

If a C API expects a struct by value, or if you want to read struct members without writing C helper functions, you can
define the struct layout in Perl.

=head2 The Recipe

We will create a simple geometry library that operates on Points and Rectangles.

    use v5.40;
    use Affix qw[:all];
    use Affix::Compiler;

    # 1. Compile C Library
    my $c = Affix::Compiler->new();
    $c->add( \<<~'END', lang => 'c' );
        typedef struct {
            int x, y;
        } Point;

        typedef struct {
            Point top_left;
            Point bottom_right;
            int color;
        } Rect;

        // Pass by Value
        int area(Rect r) {
            int w = r.bottom_right.x - r.top_left.x;
            int h = r.bottom_right.y - r.top_left.y;
            return w * h;
        }

        // Pass by Reference (Modify in place)
        void move_rect(Rect *r, int dx, int dy) {
            r->top_left.x += dx;
            r->top_left.y += dy;
            r->bottom_right.x += dx;
            r->bottom_right.y += dy;
        }
    END
    my $lib = $c->link;

    # 2. Define Types
    # Order matters! Defined in the same order as the C struct.
    typedef Point => Struct [
        x => Int,
        y => Int
    ];

    # We can nest types. Point() refers to the typedef above.
    typedef Rect => Struct [
        tl    => Point(),
        br    => Point(),
        color => Int
    ];

    # 3. Bind
    affix $lib, 'area',      [ Rect() ]           => Int;
    affix $lib, 'move_rect', [ Pointer[Rect()], Int, Int ] => Void;

    # 4. Use (Pass by Value)
    # We represent the struct as a HashRef.
    my $r = {
        tl    => { x => 0,  y => 0 },
        br    => { x => 10, y => 20 },
        color => 0xFF00FF
    };

    say "Area: " . area($r); # 200

    # 5. Use (Pass by Reference)
    # We pass a reference to the hash.
    # Affix updates the hash members after the call.
    move_rect( $r, 5, 5 );

    say "New TL: $r->{tl}{x}, $r->{tl}{y}"; # 5, 5

=head2 How It Works

=over

=item B<1. Structural Typing>

    typedef Point => Struct [ x => Int, y => Int ];

Affix calculates the memory layout (padding, alignment, size) of the struct matching the platform's C ABI.

=item B<2. HashRef Marshalling>

When you pass a HashRef to a C<Struct> argument, Affix packs the hash values into a temporary C memory block. When the
call returns, if you passed a reference (step 5), Affix unpacks the C memory back into your HashRef, updating any
changed values.

=item B<3. Nesting>

Structs can contain other Structs, Arrays, and Pointers. Affix handles the recursive packing and unpacking
automatically.

=back

=head2 Kitchen Reminders

=over

=item * B<Performance>

Marshalling a deep HashRef into a C struct (and back) involves copying data. For high-performance scenarios (like
processing millions of points), use C<calloc> to allocate the struct in C memory once, and pass the pointer around.

=item * B<Missing Keys>

If your HashRef is missing a key defined in the Struct, Affix assumes 0 (or NULL).

=back

=head1 Chapter 14: Smart Enums (Dualvars)

C headers are full of C<enum> definitions. To the C compiler, these are just integers. To the programmer, they have
semantic meaning.

When binding these functions to Perl, passing magic numbers (like C<0>, C<1>, C<2>) makes your code unreadable. Affix
solves this by allowing you to define Enums that generate **Perl Constants** and return **Dualvars**.

=head2 The Recipe

We will wrap a hypothetical state machine library.

    use v5.40;
    use Affix qw[:all];

=head2 How It Works

=over

=item B<1. Constants Generation>

When you call C<typedef ... Enum [...]>, Affix calculates the integer value of every element in the list. It then
installs a constant subroutine (e.g., C<sub STATE_IDLE () { 0 }>) into your current package. This allows you to use the
names directly in your Perl code.

=item B<2. Expression Parsing>

Affix includes a small expression parser. This allows you to copy-paste definitions from C headers—like bit shifts
(C<<< 1 << 4 >>>) or combinations (C<FLAG_A | FLAG_B>)—directly into your Affix definition without manually
calculating the result.

=item B<3. Dualvars>

When a C function returns a value defined as an C<Enum> type, Affix looks up the integer in the definition map. If
found, it returns a Scalar with B<both> slots filled:     * IV (Integer Value): 2     * PV (String Value):
"STATE_PAUSED"

This allows you to write readable code (C<eq 'STATE_...'>) while maintaining high performance for numeric comparisons.

=back

=head2 Kitchen Reminders

=over

=item * B<Unknown Values>

If the C library returns an integer that you didn't define in your Enum list (e.g., a new error code added in a library
update), Affix returns the integer as a string (e.g., value C<100> becomes string C<"100">). It does not crash.

=item * B<Scope>

The constants are installed into the package where C<typedef> is called. If you put your Affix setup in a utility
module (e.g., C<MyApp::Lib>), callers will need to import those constants or refer to them fully qualified
(C<MyApp::Lib::STATE_IDLE>).

=head1 Chapter 15: SIMD Vectors (Number Crunching)

Standard Perl scalars are designed for flexibility, not raw math throughput. When you need to process millions of
coordinates, pixels, or audio samples, you want B<SIMD> (Single Instruction, Multiple Data).

Affix makes SIMD vectors (like C<__m128>, C<__m256>, C<float32x4_t>) first-class citizens.

=head2 The Recipe

We will wrap a hypothetical 3D math library that uses 128-bit vectors (4 floats).

    use v5.40;
    use Affix qw[:all];
    use Affix::Compiler;

    # 1. Compile C Library
    # We use GCC/Clang vector extensions for this example.
    my $c = Affix::Compiler->new();
    $c->add( \<<~'END', lang => 'c' );
        #if defined(__GNUC__) || defined(__clang__)
            typedef float v4f __attribute__((vector_size(16)));

            // Add two vectors
            v4f add_vecs(v4f a, v4f b) {
                return a + b;
            }

            // Scale a vector by a scalar
            v4f scale_vec(v4f v, float s) {
                return v * s;
            }

            // Dot product (returns scalar)
            float dot_vec(v4f a, v4f b) {
                v4f res = a * b;
                return res[0] + res[1] + res[2] + res[3];
            }
        #endif
    END
    my $lib = $c->link;

    # 2. Bind
    # We define a generic "Vec4" type: v[4:float]
    typedef Vec4 => Vector[ 4, Float ];

    affix $lib, 'add_vecs',  [ Vec4(), Vec4() ] => Vec4();
    affix $lib, 'scale_vec', [ Vec4(), Float ]  => Vec4;
    affix $lib, 'dot_vec',   [ Vec4(), Vec4() ] => Float;

    # 3. Use (Packed Strings - The Fast Way)
    # Pack 4 floats into a 16-byte string
    my $v1 = pack( 'f4', 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0 );
    my $v2 = pack( 'f4', 5.0, 6.0, 7.0, 8.0 );

    # Add
    my $sum_ref = add_vecs( $v1, $v2 );

    # Results come back as ArrayRefs by default (for convenience)
    say "Sum: " . join(", ", @$sum_ref); # 6, 8, 10, 12

    # 4. Use (ArrayRefs - The Convenient Way)
    # You can also pass ArrayRefs directly. Affix handles the packing.
    my $scaled_ref = scale_vec( [1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0], 0.5 );
    say "Scaled: " . join(", ", @$scaled_ref); # 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5

    # 5. Dot Product
    my $dot = dot_vec( $v1, $v2 );
    say "Dot Product: $dot"; # 1*5 + 2*6 + 3*7 + 4*8 = 70

=head2 How It Works

=over

=item B<1. First-Class Types>

    Vector[ 4, Float ]

Affix understands that this is not just an array, but a specific machine type (128-bit register). On x64, this maps to
C<__m128> and is passed in SSE registers (XMM0, etc.). On ARM64, it maps to NEON registers (V0, etc.).

=item B<2. Packed String Input>

    my $v1 = pack( 'f4', ... );

This is the most efficient way to work. You are creating the raw binary layout of the vector in a Perl scalar. Affix
simply passes the pointer to this data directly to the C function (or loads it into a register). This avoids the
overhead of iterating over a Perl array and converting individual values.

=item B<3. ArrayRef Output>

By default, Affix unpacks returned vectors into a Perl ArrayRef (e.g., C<[x, y, z, w]>). This is convenient for
debugging or light math.

=back

=head2 Kitchen Reminders

=over

=item * B<Alignment>

SIMD instructions are picky about alignment. When you use C<pack>, Perl usually handles the string buffer allocation,
but it doesn't guarantee 16-byte alignment. Affix handles the move to the register safely. If you use C<malloc> to
store vectors for C functions, be sure to use an aligned allocation if the C library requires it.

=item * B<Aliases>

Affix exports aliases for common SIMD types if you import C<:types>:     * C<M128>  -> C<Vector[4, Float]>     *
C<M128d> -> C<Vector[2, Double]>     * C<M256>  -> C<Vector[8, Float]>  (AVX)

=back

=head1 Chapter 16: Function Pointers in Structs (Virtual Tables)

In C, Object-Oriented Programming is often simulated using structs containing function pointers. This pattern is often
called a "VTable" (Virtual Method Table). It allows a library to call different implementations of a function depending
on the object it is holding.

Affix allows you to populate these fields with Perl subroutines, effectively creating a Perl class that C can call
into.

=head2 The Recipe

We will wrap a hypothetical "Plugin" system. The C library expects a struct containing handlers for `init` and
`process`.

    use v5.40;
    use Affix qw[:all];
    use Affix::Compiler;

    # 1. Compile C Library
    my $c = Affix::Compiler->new();
    $c->add( \<<~'END', lang => 'c' );
        typedef struct {
            const char* name;
            int (*init)(void);
            void (*process)(const char* data);
        } Plugin;

        void run_plugin(Plugin* p, const char* data) {
            if (p->init()) {
                p->process(data);
            }
        }
    END
    my $lib = $c->link;

    # 2. Define Types
    # The struct fields must include the Callback signature.
    typedef Plugin => Struct [
        name    => String,
        init    => Callback[ [] => Int ],
        process => Callback[ [String] => Void ]
    ];

    # 3. Bind
    affix $lib, 'run_plugin', [ Pointer[Plugin()], String ] => Void;

    # 4. Create the Perl "Object"
    # We use a HashRef to represent the struct.
    # The callback fields are populated with anonymous subs.
    my $my_plugin = {
        name    => "PerlPlugin v1.0",

        init    => sub {
            say "Initializing Perl Plugin...";
            return 1; # Success
        },

        process => sub ($data) {
            say "Processing data in Perl: $data";
        }
    };

    # 5. Call C
    # We pass the reference to our hash. Affix packs it into the C struct,
    # creating trampolines for the subroutines automatically.
    run_plugin( $my_plugin, "Some Input Data" );

=head2 How It Works

=over

=item B<1. Nested Callbacks>

    init => Callback[ [] => Int ]

When you define a struct member as a C<Callback>, Affix expects a Perl CodeRef (sub) in that hash field.

=item B<2. Auto-Trampolining>

When you pass the HashRef C<$my_plugin> to the C function, Affix: 1. Allocates the C struct. 2. Copies the string
"PerlPlugin v1.0". 3. Generates B<Reverse Trampolines> for the C<init> and C<process> subs. 4. Stores the function
pointers to those trampolines in the struct.

=item B<3. Execution>

When C calls C<p->process(data)>, it hits the trampoline, which calls your Perl sub.

=back

=head2 Kitchen Reminders

=over

=item * B<Lifetime Management>

The trampolines generated for struct members exist only for the duration of the call to C<run_plugin>. If the C library
stores this struct pointer globally and tries to call the callbacks I<after> C<run_plugin> returns, the program will
crash.

If you need persistent callbacks, you must manually allocate the struct using C<calloc> and assigning the fields,
ensuring the Perl variables stay in scope.

=back

=head1 Chapter 17: Direct Marshalling (Benchmarks)

Speed. Sometimes you need a lot of it.

Standard Affix calls involve a "Marshalling" phase: Perl values are converted to C values, stored in a buffer, passed
to the JIT trampoline, and then passed to the C function. This is flexible, but adds overhead.

B<Direct Marshalling> removes the middleman. Affix generates a specialized JIT trampoline that knows how to read your
Perl variables directly.

=head2 The Recipe

We will compare the standard C<wrap> against C<direct_wrap> using a simple addition function.

    use v5.40;
    use Affix qw[:all];
    use Affix::Compiler;
    use Benchmark qw[cmpthese];

    # 1. Compile
    my $c = Affix::Compiler->new();
    $c->add( \<<~'END', lang => 'c' );
        int add(int a, int b) { return a + b; }
    END
    my $lib = $c->link;

    # 2. Standard Bind
    my $std_add = wrap $lib, 'add', [Int, Int] => Int;

    # 3. Direct Bind
    # The syntax is identical, just a different function name.
    my $fast_add = direct_wrap $lib, 'add', [Int, Int] => Int;

    # 4. Benchmark
    my $x = 10;
    my $y = 20;

    cmpthese( -5, {
        Standard => sub { $std_add->($x, $y) },
        Direct   => sub { $fast_add->($x, $y) }
    });

=head2 The Results

On a typical machine, Direct Marshalling can be faster for simple primitives.

                   Rate Standard   Direct
    Standard 27006813/s       --      -2%
    Direct   27626341/s       2%       --

The difference between the two grows as the number of parameters grows.

=head2 How It Works

=over

=item * B<Standard Trampoline>

    Perl Stack -> Argument Buffer -> C Trampoline -> C Function

The trampoline is generic. It expects arguments to be laid out in a specific C array format.

=item * B<Direct Trampoline>

    Perl Stack -> C Function (via custom JIT)

Affix generates machine code that calls into the Perl API (e.g. C<SvIV>) directly to fetch values from the Perl stack,
puts them into CPU registers, and jumps straight to the target function.

=back

=head2 Kitchen Reminders

=over

=item * B<Experimental>

This feature is currently marked as B<Experimental> because it is not as feature complete as the mainline affix and
wrap functions. It supports primitives (Int, Float, Pointer) robustly, but complex aggregates (Structs by value) may
fallback to standard marshalling or behave unexpectedly in edge cases.

=item * B<Restrictions>

Direct marshalling relies on knowing exact types at compile time. It is less forgiving of type mismatches (e.g. passing
an Object where an Int is expected) than the standard path, which often attempts coercion.

=head1 Chapter 18: Troubleshooting & Debugging

When Perl goes wrong, you get an error message. When C goes wrong, you get a Segmentation Fault, a frozen terminal, or
data corruption that only shows up three hours later.

This chapter provides a survival kit for when things go bump in the night.

=head2 The Bug: The Vanishing Callback

A common source of crashes in FFI is the **Scope Mismatch**. Perl relies on Reference Counting. C relies on you knowing
what you are doing.

    # 1. C Library (Event System)
    # void register_handler(void (*cb)(void));
    # void trigger_event();

    # 2. Perl Binding
    affix $lib, 'register_handler', [ Callback[ []=>Void ] ] => Void;
    affix $lib, 'trigger_event',    [] => Void;

    # 3. The Buggy Code
    sub setup {
        # We pass an anonymous subroutine.
        # Affix creates a trampoline for it.
        register_handler( sub { say "Event!" } );

        # END OF SCOPE
        # The anonymous sub has refcount 0. Perl frees it.
        # The trampoline is destroyed.
    }

    setup();

    # ... later ...
    trigger_event(); # SEGFAULT! C jumps to freed memory.

=head2 The Fix

You must ensure the Perl CodeRef lives as long as the C library needs it.

    my $KEEP_ALIVE; # Global or Object-level storage

    sub setup {
        $KEEP_ALIVE = sub { say "Event!" };
        register_handler( $KEEP_ALIVE );
    }

    # ...
    trigger_event(); # Works!

=head2 The Debugging Toolbox

Affix provides tools to inspect raw memory and internal states.

=head3 1. C<Affix::dump( $ptr, $bytes )>

If you suspect struct alignment issues or garbage data, look at the raw bytes.

    my $ptr = malloc(16);
    # ... C writes to ptr ...

    # Dump 16 bytes to STDOUT in Hex/ASCII format
    Affix::dump($ptr, 16);

=head3 2. C<address( $ptr )> & C<is_null( $ptr )>

Sanity check your pointers. A pointer value of C<0> (NULL) or C<0xFFFFFF...> (Uninitialized memory) is a smoking gun.

    my $ptr = some_c_function();
    say sprintf("Pointer address: 0x%X", address($ptr));

=head3 3. C<get_system_error()>

If a C function returns C<-1> or C<NULL> to indicate failure, it usually sets a system error code (errno/GetLastError).

    if ( some_call() < 0 ) {
        die "C Error: " . get_system_error();
    }

=head3 4. C<sv_dump( $scalar )>

Debugging the Perl side. If Affix refuses to accept a variable, checking its internal flags (Integer vs String,
Read-only status) often reveals why.

    my $val = 10;
    sv_dump($val);
    # flags=IOK,pIOK... (Good, it's a number)

=head2 Common Pitfalls

=over

=item * B<Writing to Strings>

C<String> arguments (C<const char*>) are read-only copies. If the C function modifies the string in-place, you MUST use
C<Pointer[Char]> and pass a mutable scalar.

=item * B<Struct Padding>

C compilers insert padding bytes to align members. If your Perl C<Struct[...]> definition doesn't match the C
compiler's packing rules, fields will be read from the wrong offsets. Use C<dump()> to verify alignment.

=item * B<VarArg Types>

Passing a Perl float to a variadic function? It promotes to C<double>. Passing an Int? It promotes to C<int64_t>. If
the C function expects a 32-bit int, use C<coerce(Int32, $val)>.
