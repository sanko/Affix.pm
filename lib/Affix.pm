=head1 NAME

Affix - A Foreign Function Interface eXtension

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Affix;

    affix( 'libfoo', 'bar', [Str, Float] => Double );
    print bar( 'Baz', 3.14 );

    # or

    my $bar = wrap( 'libfoo', 'bar', [Str, Float] => Double );
    print $bar->( 'Baz', 3.14 );

    # or

    sub bar : Native('libfoo') : Signature([Str, Float] => Double);
    print bar( 'Baz', 10.9 );

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Affix is a wrapper around L<dyncall|https://dyncall.org/>. If you're looking to
design your own low level FFI, see L<Dyn.pm|Dyn>.

But if you're just looking for a fast FFI system, keep reading.

Note: This is experimental software and is subject to change as long as this
disclaimer is here.

=head1 Basic Usage

The basic API here is rather simple but not lacking in power.

=head2 C<affix( ... )>

    affix( 'C:\Windows\System32\user32.dll', 'pow', [Double, Double] => Double );
    warn pow( 3, 5 );

Attaches a given symbol in a named perl sub.

Parameters include:

=over

=item C<$lib>

path of the library as a string or pointer returned by L<< C<dlLoadLibrary( ...
)>|Dyn::Load/C<dlLoadLibrary( ... )> >>

=item C<$symbol_name>

the name of the symbol to call

=item C<$parameters>

signature defining argument types in an array

=item C<$return>

return type

=item C<$name>

optional name of affixed sub; C<$symbol_name> by default

=back

Returns a code reference on success.

=head2 C<wrap( ... )>

Creates a wrapper around a given symbol in a given library.

    my $pow = wrap( 'C:\Windows\System32\user32.dll', 'pow', [Double, Double] => Double );
    warn $pow->(5, 10); # 5**10

Parameters include:

=over

=item C<$lib>

pointer returned by L<< C<dlLoadLibrary( ... )>|Dyn::Load/C<dlLoadLibrary( ...
)> >> or the path of the library as a string

=item C<$symbol_name>

the name of the symbol to call

=item C<$parameters>

signature defining argument types in an array

=item C<$return>

return type

=back

C<wrap( ... )> behaves exactly like C<affix( ... )> but returns an anonymous
subroutine.

=head1 C<:Native> CODE attribute

All the sugar is right here in the :Native code attribute. This API is inspired
by L<Raku's C<native> trait|https://docs.raku.org/language/nativecall>.

A simple example would look like this:

    use Affix;
    sub some_argless_function :Native('something');
    some_argless_function();

The first line imports various code attributes and types. The next line looks
like a relatively ordinary Perl sub declaration--with a twist. We use the
C<:Native> attribute in order to specify that the sub is actually defined in a
native library. The platform-specific extension (e.g., .so or .dll), as well as
any customary prefixes (e.g., lib) will be added for you.

The first time you call "some_argless_function", the "libsomething" will be
loaded and the "some_argless_function" will be located in it. A call will then
be made. Subsequent calls will be faster, since the symbol handle is retained.

Of course, most functions take arguments or return values--but everything else
that you can do is just adding to this simple pattern of declaring a Perl sub,
naming it after the symbol you want to call and marking it with the
C<:Native>-related attributes.

Except in the case you are using your own compiled libraries, or any other kind
of bundled library, shared libraries are versioned, i.e., they will be in a
file C<libfoo.so.x.y.z>, and this shared library will be symlinked to
C<libfoo.so.x>. By default, Affix will pick up that file if it's the only
existing one. This is why it's safer, and advisable, to always include a
version, this way:

    sub some_argless_function :Native('foo', v1.2.3)

Please check L<the section on the ABIE<sol>API version|/ABI/API version> for
more information.

=head2 Changing names

Sometimes you want the name of your Perl subroutine to be different from the
name used in the library you're loading. Maybe the name is long or has
different casing or is otherwise cumbersome within the context of the module
you are trying to create.

Affix provides the C<:Symbol> attribute for you to specify the name of the
native routine in your library that may be different from your Perl subroutine
name.

    package Foo;
    use Affix;
    sub init :Native('foo') :Symbol('FOO_INIT');

Inside of C<libfoo> there is a routine called C<FOO_INIT> but, since we're
creating a module called C<Foo> and we'd rather call the routine as
C<Foo::init> (instead of C<Foo::FOO_INIT>), we use the symbol trait to specify
the name of the symbol in C<libfoo> and call the subroutine whatever we want
(C<init> in this case).

=head2 Passing and returning values

Normal Perl signatures do not convey the type of arguments a native function
expects and what it returns so you must define them with our final attribute:
C<:Signature>

    use Affix;
    sub add :Native("calculator") :Signature([Int, Int] => Int);

Here, we have declared that the function takes two 32-bit integers and returns
a 32-bit integer. You can find the other types that you may pass L<further down
this page|/Types>.

=head1 Signatures

Affix's advisory signatures are required to give us a little hint about what we
should expect.

    [ Int, ArrayRef[ Int, 100 ], Str ] => Int

Arguments are defined in a list: C<[ Int, ArrayRef[ Char, 5 ], Str ]>

The return value comes next: C<Int>

To call the function with such a signature, your Perl would look like this:

    mh $int = func( 500, [ 'a', 'b', 'x', '4', 'H' ], 'Test');

See the aptly named sections entitled L<Types|/Types> for more on the possible
types and L<Calling Conventions/Calling Conventions> for flags that may also be
defined as part of your signature.

=head1 Library Paths and Names

The C<:Native> attribute, C<affix( ... )>, and C<wrap( ... )> all accept the
library name, the full path, or a subroutine returning either of the two. When
using the library name, the name is assumed to be prepended with lib and
appended with C<.so> (or just appended with C<.dll> on Windows), and will be
searched for in the paths in the C<LD_LIBRARY_PATH> (C<PATH> on Windows)
environment variable.

You can also put an incomplete path like C<'./foo'> and Affix will
automatically put the right extension according to the platform specification.
If you wish to suppress this expansion, simply pass the string as the body of a
block.

    sub bar :Native({ './lib/Non Standard Naming Scheme' });

B<BE CAREFUL>: the C<:Native> attribute and constant might be evaluated at
compile time.

=head2 ABI/API version

If you write C<:Native('foo')>, Affix will search C<libfoo.so> under Unix like
system (C<libfoo.dynlib> on macOS, C<foo.dll> on Windows). In most modern
system it will require you or the user of your module to install the
development package because it's recommended to always provide an API/ABI
version to a shared library, so C<libfoo.so> ends often being a symbolic link
provided only by a development package.

To avoid that, the C<:Native> attribute allows you to specify the API/ABI
version. It can be a full version or just a part of it. (Try to stick to Major
version, some BSD code does not care for Minor.)

    use Affix;
    sub foo1 :Native('foo', v1); # Will try to load libfoo.so.1
    sub foo2 :Native('foo', v1.2.3); # Will try to load libfoo.so.1.2.3

    sub pow : Native('m', v6) : Signature([Double, Double] => Double);

=head2 Calling into the standard library

If you want to call a function that's already loaded, either from the standard
library or from your own program, you can omit the library value or pass and
explicit C<undef>.

For example on a UNIX-like operating system, you could use the following code
to print the home directory of the current user:

    use Affix;
    use Data::Dumper;
    typedef PwStruct => Struct [
        name  => Str,     # username
        pass  => Str,     # hashed pass if shadow db isn't in use
        uuid  => UInt,    # user
        guid  => UInt,    # group
        gecos => Str,     # real name
        dir   => Str,     # ~/
        shell => Str      # bash, etc.
    ];
    sub getuid : Native : Signature([]=>Int);
    sub getpwuid : Native : Signature([Int]=>Pointer[PwStruct]);
    my $data = main::getpwuid( getuid() );
    print Dumper( ptr2sv( $data, Pointer [ PwStruct() ] ) );

=head1 Exported Variables

Variables exported by a library - also names "global" or "extern" variables -
can be accessed using C<pin( ... )>.

=head2 C<pin( ... )>

    pin( $errno, 'libc', 'errno', Int );
    print $errno;
    $errno = 0;

This code applies magic to C<$error> that binds it to the integer variable
named "errno" as exported by the L<libc> library.

Expected parameters include:

=over

=item C<$var>

Perl scalar that will be bound to the exported variable.

=item C<$lib>

pointer returned by L<< C<dlLoadLibrary( ... )>|Dyn::Load/C<dlLoadLibrary( ...
)> >> or the path of the library as a string

=item C<$symbol_name>

the name of the exported variable

=item C<$type>

type that data will be coerced in or out of as required

=back

This is likely broken on BSD. Patches welcome.

=head1 Memory Functions

To help toss raw data around, some standard memory related functions are
exposed here. You may import them by name or with the C<:memory> or C<:all>
tags.

=head2 C<malloc( ... )>

    my $ptr = malloc( $size );

Allocates C<$size> bytes of uninitialized storage.

=head2 C<calloc( ... )>

    my $ptr = calloc( $num, $size );

Allocates memory for an array of C<$num> objects of C<$size> and initializes
all bytes in the allocated storage to zero.

=head2 C<realloc( ... )>

    $ptr = realloc( $ptr, $new_size );

Reallocates the given area of memory. It must be previously allocated by
C<malloc( ... )>, C<calloc( ... )>, or C<realloc( ... )> and not yet freed with
a call to C<free( ... )> or C<realloc( ... )>. Otherwise, the results are
undefined.

=head2 C<free( ... )>

    free( $ptr );

Deallocates the space previously allocated by C<malloc( ... )>, C<calloc( ...
)>, or C<realloc( ... )>.

=head2 C<memchr( ... )>

    memchr( $ptr, $ch, $count );

Finds the first occurrence of C<$ch> in the initial C<$count> bytes (each
interpreted as unsigned char) of the object pointed to by C<$ptr>.

=head2 C<memcmp( ... )>

    my $cmp = memcmp( $lhs, $rhs, $count );

Compares the first C<$count> bytes of the objects pointed to by C<$lhs> and
C<$rhs>. The comparison is done lexicographically.

=head2 C<memset( ... )>

    memset( $dest, $ch, $count );

Copies the value C<$ch> into each of the first C<$count> characters of the
object pointed to by C<$dest>.

=head2 C<memcpy( ... )>

    memcpy( $dest, $src, $count );

Copies C<$count> characters from the object pointed to by C<$src> to the object
pointed to by C<$dest>.

=head2 C<memmove( ... )>

    memmove( $dest, $src, $count );

Copies C<$count> characters from the object pointed to by C<$src> to the object
pointed to by C<$dest>.

=head2 C<sizeof( ... )>

    my $size = sizeof( Int );
    my $size1 = sizeof( Struct[ name => Str, age => Int ] );

Returns the size, in bytes, of the L<type|/Types> passed to it.

=head2 C<offsetof( ... )>

    my $struct = Struct[ name => Str, age => Int ];
    my $offset = offsetof( $struct, 'age' );

Returns the offset, in bytes, from the beginning of a structure including
padding, if any.

=head1 Utility Functions

Here's some thin cushions for the rougher edges of wrapping libraries.

They may be imported by name for now but might be renamed, removed, or changed
in the future.

=head2 C<cast( ... )>

    my $hash = cast( $ptr, Struct[i => Int, ... ] );

This function will parse a pointer into a given target type.

The source pointer would have normally been obtained from a call to a native
subroutine that returned a pointer, a lvalue pointer to a native subroutine,
or, as part of a C<Struct[ ... ]>.

=head2 C<DumpHex( ... )>

    DumpHex( $ptr, $length );

Dumps C<$length> bytes of raw data from a given point in memory.

This is a debugging function that probably shouldn't find its way into your
code and might not be public in the future.

=head1 Types

While Raku offers a set of native types with a fixed, and known, representation
in memory but this is Perl so we need to do the work ourselves and design and
build a pseudo-type system. Affix supports the fundamental types (void, int,
etc.) and aggregates (struct, array, union).

=head2 Fundamental Types with Native Representation


    Affix       C99/C++     Rust    C#          pack()  Raku
    -----------------------------------------------------------------------

    Str         char *

Given sizes are minimums measured in bits

=head3 C<Void>

The C<Void> type corresponds to the C C<void> type. It is generally found in
typed pointers representing the equivalent to the C<void *> pointer in C.

    sub malloc :Native :Signature([Size_t] => Pointer[Void]);
    my $data = malloc( 32 );

As the example shows, it's represented by a parameterized C<Pointer[ ... ]>
type, using as parameter whatever the original pointer is pointing to (in this
case, C<void>). This role represents native pointers, and can be used wherever
they need to be represented in a Perl script.

In addition, you may place a C<Void> in your signature to skip a passed
argument.

=head3 C<Bool>

Boolean type may only have room for one of two values: C<true> or C<false>.

=head3 C<Char>

Signed character. It's guaranteed to have a width of at least 8 bits.

Pointers (C<Pointer[Char]>) might be better expressed with a C<Str>.

=head3 C<UChar>

Unsigned character. It's guaranteed to have a width of at least 8 bits.

=head3 C<Short>

Signed short integer. It's guaranteed to have a width of at least 16 bits.

=head3 C<UShort>

Unsigned short integer. It's guaranteed to have a width of at least 16 bits.

=head3 C<Int>

Basic signed integer type.

It's guaranteed to have a width of at least 16 bits. However, on 32/64 bit
systems it is almost exclusively guaranteed to have width of at least 32 bits.

=head3 C<UInt>

Basic unsigned integer type.

It's guaranteed to have a width of at least 16 bits. However, on 32/64 bit
systems it is almost exclusively guaranteed to have width of at least 32 bits.

=head3 C<Long>

Signed long integer type. It's guaranteed to have a width of at least 32 bits.

=head3 C<ULong>

Unsigned long integer type. It's guaranteed to have a width of at least 32
bits.

=head3 C<LongLong>

Signed long long integer type. It's guaranteed to have a width of at least 64
bits.

=head3 C<ULongLong>

Unsigned long long integer type. It's guaranteed to have a width of at least 64
bits.

=head3 C<Float>

L<Single precision floating-point
type|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-precision_floating-point_format>.

=head3 C<Double>

L<Double precision floating-point
type|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-precision_floating-point_format>.

=head3 C<SSize_t>

Signed integer type.

=head3 C<Size_t>

Unsigned integer type often expected as the result of C<sizeof> or C<offsetof>
but can be found elsewhere.

=head2 C<Str>

Automatically handle null terminated character pointers with this rather than
trying using C<Pointer[Char]> and doing it yourself.

You'll learn a bit more about C<Pointer[...]> and other parameterized types in
the next section.

=head1 Parameterized Types

Some types must be provided with more context data.

=head2 C<Pointer[ ... ]>

    Pointer[Int]  ~~ int *
    Pointer[Void] ~~ void *

Create pointers to (almost) all other defined types including C<Struct> and
C<Void>.

To handle a pointer to an object, see L<InstanceOf>.

Void pointers (C<Pointer[Void]>) might be created with C<malloc> and other
memory related functions.

=begin future

=head2 C<Aggregate>

This is currently undefined and reserved for possible future use.

=end future

=head2 C<Struct[ ... ]>

    Struct[                    struct {
        dob => Struct[              struct {
            year  => Int,               int year;
            month => Int,   ~~          int month;
            day   => Int                int day;
        ],                          } dob;
        name => Str,                char *name;
        wId  => Long                long wId;
    ];                          };

A struct consists of a sequence of members with storage allocated in an ordered
sequence (as opposed to C<Union>, which is a type consisting of a sequence of
members where storage overlaps).

A C struct that looks like this:

    struct {
        char *make;
        char *model;
        int   year;
    };

...would be defined this way:

    Struct[
        make  => Str,
        model => Str,
        year  => Int
    ];

All fundamental and aggregate types may be found inside of a C<Struct>.

=head2 C<ArrayRef[ ... ]>

The elements of the array must pass the additional size constraint.

An array length must be given:

    ArrayRef[Int, 5];   # int arr[5]
    ArrayRef[Any, 20];  # SV * arr[20]
    ArrayRef[Char, 5];  # char arr[5]
    ArrayRef[Str, 10];  # char *arr[10]

=head2 C<Union[ ... ]>

A union is a type consisting of a sequence of members with overlapping storage
(as opposed to C<Struct>, which is a type consisting of a sequence of members
whose storage is allocated in an ordered sequence).

The value of at most one of the members can be stored in a union at any one
time and the union is only as big as necessary to hold its largest member
(additional unnamed trailing padding may also be added). The other members are
allocated in the same bytes as part of that largest member.

A C union that looks like this:

    union {
        char  c[5];
        float f;
    };

...would be defined this way:

    Union[
        c => ArrayRef[Char, 5],
        f => Float
    ];

=head2 C<CodeRef[ ... ]>

A value where C<ref($value)> equals C<CODE>. This would be how callbacks are
defined.

The argument list and return value must be defined. For example,
C<CodeRef[[Int, Int]=>Int]> ~~ C<typedef int (*fuc)(int a, int b);>; that is to
say our function accepts two integers and returns an integer.

    CodeRef[[] => Void];                # typedef void (*function)();
    CodeRef[[Pointer[Int]] => Int];     # typedef Int (*function)(int * a);
    CodeRef[[Str, Int] => Struct[...]]; # typedef struct Person (*function)(chat * name, int age);

=head2 C<InstanceOf[ ... ]>

    InstanceOf['Some::Class']

A blessed object of a certain type. When used as an lvalue, the result is
properly blessed. As an rvalue, the reference is checked to be a subclass of
the given package.

=head2 C<Any>

Anything you dump here will be passed along unmodified. We hand off a pointer
to the C<SV*> perl gives us without copying it.

=head2 C<Enum[ ... ]>

The value of an C<Enum> is defined by its underlying type which includes
C<Int>, C<Char>, etc.

This type is declared with an list of strings.

    Enum[ 'ALPHA', 'BETA' ];
    # ALPHA = 0
    # BETA  = 1

Unless an enumeration constant is defined in an array reference, its value is
the value one greater than the value of the previous enumerator in the same
enumeration. The value of the first enumerator (if it is not defined) is zero.

    Enum[ 'A', 'B', [C => 10], 'D', [E => 1], 'F', [G => 'F + C'] ];
    # A = 0
    # B = 1
    # C = 10
    # D = 11
    # E = 1
    # F = 2
    # G = 12

    Enum[ [ one => 'a' ], 'two', [ 'three' => 'one' ] ]
    # one   = a
    # two   = b
    # three = a

As you can see, enum values may allude to earlier defined values and even basic
arithmetic is supported.

Additionally, if you C<typedef> the enum into a given namespace, you may refer
to elements by name. They are defined as dualvars so that works:

    typedef color => Enum[ 'RED', 'GREEN', 'BLUE' ];
    print color::RED();     # RED
    print int color::RED(); # 0

=head2 C<IntEnum[ ... ]>

Same as C<Enum>.

=head2 C<UIntEnum[ ... ]>

C<Enum> but with unsigned integers.

=head2 C<CharEnum[ ... ]>

C<Enum> but with signed chars.

    MessageBoxA(0, "We have NativeCall", "ohai", 64);

=head2 Short tutorial on calling a C function

This is an example for calling a standard function and using the returned
information.

C<getaddrinfo> is a POSIX standard function for obtaining network information
about a network node, e.g., C<google.com>. It is an interesting function to
look at because it illustrates a number of the elements of Affix.

The Linux manual provides the following information about the C callable
function:

    int getaddrinfo(const char *node, const char *service,
       const struct addrinfo *hints,
       struct addrinfo **res);

The function returns a response code 0 for success and 1 for error. The data
are extracted from a linked list of C<addrinfo> elements, with the first
element pointed to by C<res>.

From the table of Affix types we know that an C<int> is C<Int>. We also know
that a C<char *> is best expressed with C<Str>. But C<addrinfo> is a structure,
which means we will need to write our own type class. However, the function
declaration is straightforward:
